# Ecommerce Website "Resume"

This version of [Resume](https://resume-amber-six.vercel.app) is a prototype for an ecommerce website. It serves as a front-end platform aimed at connecting software engineers and tech workers with expert resume services at an affordable rate.

[Resume](https://resume-amber-six.vercel.app) uses Next.js with [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org).

The **Redux Toolkit** is a standardized way to write Redux logic (create actions and reducers, setup the store with some default middlewares like redux devtools extension).

## Project Goals

-   Develop a cutting-edge ecommerce website that embodies modern design principles and user experience.

-   Establish a distinctive brand identity by creating a cohesive theme with appropriate fonts, written content for a strong market presence.

-   Acquire proficiency in new technologies and improve existing tech stack including Next.js, SCSS, Vercel deployment, SVG integration, Next.js routing, and Redux state management.

-   Implement a structured and efficient file organization system to enhance code maintainability and scalability.
